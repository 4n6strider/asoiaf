Character Interaction Networks for George R. R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" saga

These networks were created by connecting two characters whenever their names (or nicknames) appeared within 15 words of one another in one of the books in "A Song of Ice and Fire." The edge weight corresponds to the number of interactions.

You can use this data to explore the dynamics of the Seven Kingdoms using network science techniques. For exmaple, community detection finds coherent plotlines. Centrality measures uncover the multiple ways in which characters play important roles in the saga.
